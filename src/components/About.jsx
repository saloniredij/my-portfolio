                I'm a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with a strong background in AI and Machine Learning. 
                My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create innovative solutions that 
                make a real impact. I love working with modern technologies and solving complex problems through 
                code. When I'm not coding, I'm involved in social volunteering and contributing to open-source projects.
